# TCP Server Assignment
This command line application will read a bitmap (24-bit non-palette bitmap with no padding) from the project root directory and write to a new bitmap file with either a grayscale or inverted color transformation applied to it. To use this app, run `bin/bmt [bitmap] [grayscale/inverted]`. Tests can be viewed with `gulp` or `gulp test`.
